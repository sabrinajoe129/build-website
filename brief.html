<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:left;">HTML is stand for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a simple basic programming language and the backbone to build a website. HTML is super suitable a beginner. 
<br>
<br>
In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN proposed and prototype <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a>. To be specific, ENQUIRE was a software project written by Tim. It was a very simple hypertext program that had some of the same ideas as the web and Semantic Web but was slightly distinguish in several way. In 1989, Tim returned to CERN with a clever idea of building and creating a system that could help researchers in order to share and access information across different computers. This led to the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>. In 1991, Berners-Lee introduced HTML as a simple way to display and structure text on the web. Until now, people are still using and learning HTML as it helps users to link document together.

Learning basic HTML helps someone understand how web pages are built and how elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links are displayed in a browser.
Basically, you need to know about the basic structure of HTML Page such as &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;. Other than that, common tags like &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;href&gt; and etc are also important. Next, understanding the way to write and save the code in the text editor are also a crucial part. 
The main focus in learning basic HTML is to empower learners to create their own simple website and get to know the foundation of programming language in building a website without complex steps. This leads to many more complex and advanced skills such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, and more. 
<br>
<br>
Using HTML to program also can cause several common programming issues. Firstly, browser compatibility because not all browsers have similar way to render HTML elements like Safari rendering process and Chrome rendering process, both have distinct way to render. Besides, people who use HTML could carelessly making syntax errors. Like all coding, forgetting to close tags or placing them incorrectly can unintentionally break its layout. For example, using an <img> tag without alt. Other than that, accessibility can be ruined if there is missing tag like “alt” which lead to major design issue.
